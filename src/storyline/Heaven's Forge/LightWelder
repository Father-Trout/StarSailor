A Overclocked Lightwelder runs red hot, steam whistling off its rotund metallic frame. It's voice box drones out to you,
"I have overseen this forge for millennia and time has taken its toll on me. These rusty joints once shined with a coat
of star paint, but has since peeled off over the many centuries in this immense heat, and without its protective
properties, I fear for my imminent dissolution. Here.  I would off you these coordinates to your starcharts. They will
allow you to navigate to a realm where stars pour down like raindrops. Should you return with a proper barrel of star
paint, I will reinforce your hull with a barrier of hardlight. This will surely be invaluable in the exploration of
more distant skies."

[1] ACCEPT THE COMMISSION- The old bucket of bolts appears a tad unstable but it understands the intricacies of welding
hardlight, and would be terribly grateful for your part in prolonging its destruction.

[2] RUN- This thing is a time bomb! It threatens to balloon into an inferno of molten shrapnel with each passing second.
Surely it will lay here in smouldering ruin long before you return with its prize?
