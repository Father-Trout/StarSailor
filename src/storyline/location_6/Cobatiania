Welcome to Cobatiania

This planet is covered in a fine blue dust high in cobalt.
The only purpose that this mineral seems to have is the main ingredient in fine blue pottery enamel.
Maybe someday will find something more useful to do with it.

Until then, there is only a pottery shop on this planet.

you can access mars and {} from here.
