Grifter's Drift, a smuggler's port nestled in the heart of Fringe Space. There dwells no greater seedbed of crime and villainy. A haven for outcasts, exiles, and shadier elements, its barren streets and ramshackle edifices are all you've ever known. Cold cobblestone trails hewn from the asteroid wind their way through a sad, sagging city of rusted plasteel and broken dreams. Celestial corsairs have hallowed this otherwise insignificant speck in the cosmos for one reason alone, being that this was the favored hideaway of Captain Kip, the most feared and revered pirate to have ever sailed the Seven Suns. Rumors abound that this is also his resting place, where his bones reside alongside his ship, and upon that lays a chart to his hidden stash. Mere legend and conjecture, surely?

Born or bound here, you are an entity endeared to this place. Define yourself

Sailor- A strong back and weathered hands, you've served on mining ships your whole life. There are scant few other resources out here, in the dark.
Scout- From the Ice Wastes to the Scrap Sea, this old rock bars no secrets from you. Intrepid treasure hunters pay well for your many services.
Smuggler- Sly and spry, with a discerning eye. Starvation led to necessity. Who says crime doesn't pay?
Scavver- The ship graveyard here known as the Scrap Sea holds many derelict devices. Your penchant for tinkering has offered you an opportunity. Eke out a living off of meager mechanical work and tub-fermented fungus.
