It sure is chilly here on Kyrgastan 9.

You are looking for a new refactor for your p-ship.
The current q-reflector works fine, but its a little squeaky when it starts up.

Most 435-series series q-reflectors cost at least 9000 PD but this one if for sale, used for 5000 PD.

The vendor gets its off of the shelf and presses the button to activate it...

It makes the typical q-reflector startup sounds and displays perfect functionality.

When you ask to touch it, the vendor jerks it back and says:
    "You can touch it once I have my 5000 PD"
