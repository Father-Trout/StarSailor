Welcome to Mars:

This Planet is quite unsafe to visit. As soon as you enter into the atmosphere tiny molecules of
spinel are inhaled and absorbed. Causing and strong desire to go to battle.

If you are able to manage the fury, there are valuable things to be obtained here.

Upon landing, there is a department store called "Weapons are Us", and an abandoned hospital nearby.

From Here, you can go reach Wormwood Planet and {}.
