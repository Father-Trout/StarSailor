Greetings, Welcome to StarSailor!

I hope you are doing well.

Although this is just a "simple text-based adventure game", there are a few things that you should be aware of.
[You] are Captain [TODO]. You are the Captain of [TODO].
Here in StarSailor, there are a handful of 'vital signs'.

Food:
This is a class of substances which can be absorbed by the body to promote continuation of life.
You have [100] food.
    If you run out of food, you will have to exchange money for food. If you have money, you are temporarily safe
from starvation. However, it is wise to find a good constant source of food. Most moves in the game require [1] food.

Money:
Money, is the liquid asset of StarSailor, it can be exchanged for other resources. However, be aware, the rates may change
from place to place.
    Platinum Disks are the universally accepted currency in [TODO].
Be aware of losing all of your money, you may be forced to beg for money to buy food. That is a dangerous place to be.

Sanity:
When soaring through space, sanity is a precious resource. Sanity is lost whenever
you are trying something and failing consistently. Sometimes, the loss will be linear, sometime exponential, so be very careful.
Things become bleak when sanity is lost.

Inventory:

This is a your set of belongings. You may be granted or barred access to locations depending on the contents of your inventory.
There is no limit to what your satchel can hold, as it utilizes an empty pocket dimension.
