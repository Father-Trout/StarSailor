Welcome to the the Bureau of Inter-Galactic Revenue Services.

This planet is the highest power in the known universe. They are the end-all-be-all bureaucratic-red-tape

Most of this planet is under lock and key, however, there is a kiosk for performing simple tasks.

from here you can access Chevron II, and Cobaltiania.
